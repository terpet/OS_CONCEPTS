Programming Implementations
(Special Thanks to Dave Marshall for Wonderful tutorials without which these codes were not possible. Please Visit : https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/C/ for tutorials.)

1. Implementation Of Dining Philosophers Problem.
There are two solutions of DLP implemented in C. One of them is DeadLock prone.

2. Implementation Of Producer Consumer Problem.
There are three codes, all written in C. One is for Single Producer-Single Consumer and rest are for Multiple Producers_Consumers.One of the Multiple Producer-Consumer Problem code is incorrect that illustrates the need of one more semaphore.

3. Implementation Of Make_Water Problem.
It is an example of Process Synchronization where we need to form a Water Molecule using Two Hydrogen and One Oxygen Atom keeping the system deadlock free. There are two codes in this repository, one of them is deadlock prone and other is deadlock free.  

4. Creating And Accessing Shared Memory.
Shared Memory is an efficeint means of passing data between programs. One program will create a memory portion which other processes (if permitted) can access.
